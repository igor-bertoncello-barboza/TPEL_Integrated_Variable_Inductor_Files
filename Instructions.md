Dear readers,

   The modeling script file was developed in Google Colab, which uses Python code. However, it can easily be adapted for usage in other Python compilers.

   Regarding the simulation file, it is an LTspice simulation. This software is free and can be downloaded at https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html. The libraries that must be installed to properly run the simulation are available at .
