Dear readers,

   The modeling script file was developed in Google Colab, which uses Python code. However, it can easily be adapted for usage in other Python compilers.

   Regarding the simulation files, they are inside the ZIP file "Simulation". The free software LTspice was used in this work and it can be downloaded at https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html.

   The simulation itself is contained inside the file "Main File" and the libraries that must be installed are available at the folder "Libraries", inside the ZIP file. These specific libraries were released by Prof. Dr. José Marcos Alonso Álvarez in the book "Inductors: Variable and Controllable, Amazon KDP. 2021".
