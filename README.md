Dear readers,

   The modeling script file was developed in Google Colab, which uses Python code. However, it can easily be adapted for usage in other Python compilers.

   Regarding the simulation files, they are inside the ZIP file "Simulation". The free software LTspice was used in this work and it can be downloaded at https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html.

   The simulation itself is contained inside the file "Main File" and the libraries that must be installed are available at the folder "Libraries", inside the ZIP file. These specific libraries were released by Prof. Dr. José Marcos Alonso Álvarez in the book "Inductors: Variable and Controllable, Amazon KDP. 2021".

   After downloading and installing LTspice, you must include the specific libraries in the folder in which the software was installed in your computer. In order to do this you should first unzip the folder "Simulation". Then access the folder "Libraries". Inside this folder, there are two folders, one is "sub" and the other is "sym". After that, you should look for the folder "lib" inside your LTspice folder in your computer. Finally, copy the files located inside the folders "sub" and "sym" from the specific libraries folders and paste them inside their respective folders, with the same name, in the folder in which LTspice is installed in your computer. The next and final step is to double-click and run the simulation file "Main File.asc" to analyze the simulation results.
